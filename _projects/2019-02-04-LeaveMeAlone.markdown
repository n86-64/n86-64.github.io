## The Game
In the game you take the role of a student who's enjoying the comfort of their own home, until one day a group of pests turns up seeking your hard earned cash. Your task to repel the invaders and protect your home via setting up a network of defences ranging from pest sprays to deterring laundry baskets.

Players have a set amount of cash to spend on preparing and upgrading defences in the house. A wave of pests will be sent to the player and upon killing a pest the player is rewarded with an amount of cash else the players cash is depleted as the pests escape. At the end of the wave the player will then have to pay rent and if the player is unable to do so then the game ends.

## Background
This year I took part in the Global Game Jam. This is a 48-hour event in which people are required to make a game based around a preselected theme, revealed at the start of the event. The game can be of any genre and include any variation of game mechanics providing it meets the theme in question. This years theme was, "what home means to you".

*The people who I teamed up with.*

For the global game jam this year I teamed up with 5 other team members, each of which is either currently studying or has graduated from university. Our team consisted of two artists and three programmers of which I was a programmer.

As a team we considered several options for games that we could make based around the theme. This was possibly one of the most difficult phases of the process given the abstract nature of the theme and the various ways you could interoperate its meaning. Our team focused on the idea that home means security from threats, coming from this we settled on creating a tower defence game where the player would have to protect their home from various classes of intruders.

## My Role
My primary role on the game was the creation of the UI system for the game. This includes all the menus and all of the HUD elements that provide the player the information needed to make decisions in the game.
