Overthrow is a strategy board game that I along with several other team members developed as part of the play and games module on my university course. The game was inspired by several other strategy games  such as Civilisation and Terranova and supports either 2 or 4 players.

Overthrow is set around the concept of performing military coups. Each player takes the role of a military general, and to win has to take control of the capital city which is located in the centre of the board. Each player starts in marked sections on the board and this acts as there headquarters and from here the players must move towards the capital. Each turn players have a set number of actions  which allow them to perform actions such as placing tokens down to occupy tiles or attacking other armies in order to occupy territory. The number of actions is determined by the number of influence cards that a player has which will increase as the player completes objectives. These cards give players select advantages, however certain actions can result in the players getting exposure cards which result in disadvantages for the player. Hence the key to victory is a balanced strategy.

## Background:
The assignment in question was to create a board game based on current social, political or economic subjects. There was no restriction in terms of the types of mechanics that our game could incorporate providing it was a table top game. Based on this the team and I engaged in a series of discussions, these resulted in the team choosing to adopt a concept called ‘road to emperor’ which was the precursor to this game and formed the basis for this games design decisions. However this had to be modified as it was incomplete and based in a historical setting (namely ancient China).

It was due to the current events requirement that we went with the theme of military coups, which at the time a major issue following the coup in Zimbabwe. This theme both fulfilled the requirements of the brief and complimented the game mechanics which we had previously decided on in the planning stage.

## Role:
Like the other members of the group I was one of the designers on the game. My role was to assist in deciding on and refining the game mechanics. My contributions to the rules was primarily on the objectives in the game with the goal being to capture the capital my initial suggestion, as well as contributions to the creation and refinement of the influence/exposure mechanic in the game.
