Deadlock is the last of a series of games developed as part of my LLP assessment portfolio.

## About this Game
Deadlock is a turn-based network game. In this game players are required to cooperate with each other in order to complete a map objective of some form. As can be guessed from the title these said mission relate to survival in a zombie outbreak and range from finding items, to clearing the area of zombies.

The game is a built around the idea of locating and recruiting civilians. Doing so increases the size of the players army which is needed in order to face greater hordes and more complex enemy types. The players get to choose what mission they choose to engage in and then, upon making this decision are able to lobby up and play through there mission of choice.

## Gameplay and Features
Deadlock is a game that is played on a dedicated server utalisisng a client-server architecture where the players are given a choice what map to play and are then able to play the map of their choice. This is a similar system to TF2's gamemode Mann Vs Machine where the story as it were is played out as missions which can be freely chosen by the player. 

In a game the player will be given two actions, these are move and attack
