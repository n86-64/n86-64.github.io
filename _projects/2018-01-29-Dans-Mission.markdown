Dan's Mission of transmission is a simple 48hr game jam game developed as part of the 2018 Global Game Jam (GGJ).

In the game the player is given access to both a keypad and a radio. The players goal is to enter the correct key combination in order to get into the safe and steal the valuables. Now this would be easy if it weren't for those meddling scientists and their cutting edge encryption technology, making it virtually impossible to hack into the safe. *Great*, so we can't get into the safe then? Well thankfully it turns out the safe belongs to one of the most well known (and dumbest) radio hosts. Using hints provided through the various radio transmissions, the players must act quickly to decipher the code and crack the safe.

## Background
From the 26-28th of January 2018 the global game jam took place. The global game jam is an international competition where various individuals regardless of profession come together to try and make a game in 48 hrs. My university was one of many around the world that was hosting this event, and I along with two other individuals formed a team in order to participate.

All games have to be made in relation to a theme of some form. It should be no surprise that this year the theme was transmission. With this in mind we had a pretty lengthy debate as to how we should approach the game. We had a number of ideas spanning various interpretations from spreading disease to decoding audio transmissions. After much discussion we settled on this idea. Once we settled on this idea we began assigning responsibilities and I along with my teammates under the pressure of a strict deadline began work.

## My Role
My prime contribution to the game was twofold. Firstly, I was responsible for working on a mini game which would require the player to arrange various audio samples in order. The goal being to use the decoded audio sample to work out the code for the keypad and then enter the key code to unlock the safe. Whilst initially starting strong, this mini game was difficult to implement in terms of blending the audio samples and it didn't really fit in with the core mechanic of the game. Hence it was not fully finished and dropped from the final build.

Secondly, I  contributed small little infrastructural changes to the game. These changes were primarily focused on the UI and the input routines. Also, for a bit of fun I implemented a small little easter egg into the game designed to make the game a bit more enjoyable.
