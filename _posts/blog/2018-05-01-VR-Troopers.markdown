I think its safe to say that VR is technologies best equivalent to a craze right now, with companies ploughing millions into the development of VR tools and standards, as well as hundreds of new games being made ever year for the platform. It can safely be said that VR is the platform that companies are trying to break into. Of course game development is no exception and with VR playing a more prominent role in the game industry its more important than ever that developers early on gain experience developing applications for VR. Hence the reason for our assignment in our Play and Games module.

<!--more-->

In the Play and Games module we had to complete two group assignments with the second being to develop a VR experience in a team, demonstrating a new experience within VR that could be utilised in future software. We were required to research our ideas and then after deciding on a proposal, develop a simple VR application demonstrating the concept. Upon completing the application we would then be required to present it to not only our lectures but members of a firm who are currently developing VR applications.

For this assignment our team decided on developing a VR navigation system which would allow users in large environments to be able to navigate said environment with ease and without braking immersion. This concept was inspired by the various interfaces used in strategy games such as  I think its safe to say we have now completed the said VR project and it has been reviewed and marked.

## Conclusions

Overall the project despite some development issues was completed to an acceptable standard and we were able to successfully present the application to this panel. From a personal perspective the project was somewhat successful, in that it taught me how to utilise VR development tools such as Steam VR API to create VR experiences and it also taught me some of the limits and quirks of developing an application in VR, instructing me on both good and bad design practices. The final program was adequately functional and was able to demonstrate the concept in a simple and direct manner, there were no known serious issues regarding motion-sickness or controls. Users of the demo were easily able to grasp how the VR demo worked and interacted with it in the way we had expected.

However, whilst the demo was successful in meeting some of our objectives, there were some limitations with the demo. The main issue was the overall polish of the final application, it lacked many elements that would have assisted usability such as a suitable test environment and user interface. This did cause some issues during both the testing phases and in the presentation which likely resulted from the lack of external play-testing in the application. Whilst testing allowed the team to make substantial adjustments to the experience, this testing was mostly internal and not external with only one public play-testing session being held. Therefore in the next project we need to perform more random user testing on our target markets as this would more likely uncover issues for target users, allowing us to fix said issues and improve the experience.

Despite these shortcomings however, the development of this VR application has been significantly useful in helping to reinforce the concepts behind  development processes in VR as well as the games industry as a whole. Knowledge which I intend to put to practise in my next VR project to improve the development process in-turn resulting in a more refined final product.
