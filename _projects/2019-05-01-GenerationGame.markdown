### Introduction
As part of my course I took a module called advanced technology where we were required to complete a set of projects based around advanced technologies used within or that may be used within games such as physics systems. For my second task, I chose to create a system which would generate a game according to an image which could either be captured by the game or loaded into the game with classification performed using a convolutional neural network given its ability to pick out features from images and classify accordingly. The result of this is the generation game which implements these functions.
