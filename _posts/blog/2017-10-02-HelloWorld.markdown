## Hello there weary traveller.

I hope you are doing well and I would like to wish you a warm welcome to my blog.
<!--more-->
So then I hear you ask, what is this blog about?

**Why should I pay attention?**

Well this blog is where I get to record my various thoughts and happenings on many subjects from game development to personal hobbies.
Currently I am studying my second year at university and as part of one of my modules I have to maintain a log of all my activities relating
to the development of 5 games that we are required to make. Hence in the near future to can mostly expect so see details of my progress being logged here.

However that isn't all I will be talking about. Being a programmer and all it shouldn't come as a surprise to see that I do like to do my own stuff from time to time.
So you can also expect to be kept up to date on personal projects that I am working on whether they be small or large and lets just say I do have some interesting stuff
in the pipeline.

Hope to speak again soon.
Have a wonderful day.

Yours Truly

Nathan Butt
